## What is this repository?
This repo (will) contains scripts/resources for clean, bloatfree, and customized Windows 10/Windows 11 installations.

### Using Memory's [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall) answer file as a base;
  * Integrated [FR33THY's Remove Edge script](https://github.com/FR33THYFR33THY/Ultimate-Windows-Optimization-Guide/blob/main/6%20Windows/14%20Edge.ps1) - will remove Edge upon installation. No fuss.
  * Wrote a utility to install MY favourite (see below) software(s) using winget. This tool will also repair winget if it's not available for a reason. (Which happens in W10 - idk)
  * Added "Open File Location", "Open cmd here" and "Open powershell here" to right click context menu - without needing to press shift.
  * Added "Create .cpp and .hpp file" option to right click context menu - I'm a C++ programmer.
  * Changed default "wallpaper" to black. (No wallpaper)
  * Enabled some options which original disables:
    * File size information in folder tips
    * Pop-up description for folder and desktop items
    * Status bar
    * Taskbar animations
    * Translucent selection rectangle
    * Drop shadows for icon labels on desktop
  * Set taskbar buttons to show labels and never combine
  * Removed JPEG wallpaper quality limit.
  * Apply Black + #ffcf48 dark mode color theme. (No explorer patch, just colors)
  * Taskbar will be set to left instead of middle.
  * Taskbar Search bar will not be removed, instead will be made an icon.
  * Taskview button on Taskbar will not be hidden.
  * Added two cursor sets. You can browse them at [W10-W11CleanInstall/Resources/Cursors/](https://github.com/aeris170/W10-W11CleanInstall/Resources/Cursors). Default cursor will be [Obsidian](https://www.deviantart.com/teft/art/Obsidian-Cursor-set-78972293) by [teft](https://www.deviantart.com/teft/gallery).
  * ... and other stuff I fail to remember at the moment. Nothing malicious. You should still diff the original with mine. You can use an online tool or use a program like Meld.

> [!WARNING]
Please make sure you have internet during installation. Resources folder will be downloaded. If they couldn't be downloaded during installation, launch "Download Resources" from desktop.
